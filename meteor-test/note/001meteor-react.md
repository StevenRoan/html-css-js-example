# React + Meteor
### Add new package
* `meteor add react`

### Conventions
* `getMeteorData`: The object you return from `getMeteorData` can be accessed on `this.data` in same react web component

### Difference with pure Meteor
* Template will not be used, because all of the component will be defined in react

### Questions
* where does `Meteor` save those added package?
* How the web components combine(link) together?  Moving `Task.jsx` into the jsx folder and meteor can find it as well
